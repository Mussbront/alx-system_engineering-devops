Adventure Hiking the Mountain.

Mt. Kenya has very beautiful views.
Starting from the tropical rainforest, to the bamboo, then heath and moorland, you encounter a wide range of flora and fauna.
There are many bird species as well as a variety of wild animals.
The ecosystem is supported by the ever-flowing rivers that originate from the melting ice at the peaks.
A hike up the mountain, though tiring, can be very satisfying for the nature lovers.
